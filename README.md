# Project Name - FruGaol


07/08/2021 <br>
The purpose/ambition of Project FruGaol is to create an application that helps promote and encourage local commerce. This app is to connect SME’s to consumers in a more effective and meaningful way. Ultimately I want to cut the fuss out of advertising and give businesses who are on the app a platform to be able to generate more business in the locality and offer real time promos, discounts and services to people/consumers that might be looking for it. 

The idea in my head of level of connection is the likes of petrol stations can advertise their fuel prices and items or hairdressers/cleaners can advertise there availability. In this fast paced world I want this app to demonstrate and portray what business has to user and what user has to user in as real time as possible.

I also want to create an award system so that consumers are rewarded for informing other consumers of special promos/prices and whether they recommend doing business with a business.(maybe not for this assignment) 

I want this to be able to take over as the main SME to customer directory/database. I want to take everything that is good from the GoldenPages, Facebook Marketplace, Yelp, Google My Business, GroupOn, Uber and Amazon to nurture local business and help promote and grow local commerce.

## UX

The UX for this project will be investigated through the following 5 planes:

### Strategy Plane: <br>

Why are we special? – Frugaol is special because it is attempting to help smes in a way that hasn’t been done yet. It is attempting to connect local smes to the consumer in more interactive ways than other directory services of its type. The ambition is to have a platform that takes everything good with the likes of GroupOn, Marketplace, Instagram, GoldenPages, GMB etc and have this utilized into one platform where both the Business and the Consumer will find benefit with. 

Who are competitors? What are they doing?
Main competitors are the following:
- Goldenpages: So far acts as a business directory/phonebook to allow for customers to interact with businesses, however this is outdated. 
- Marketplace: Allows businesses and individuals to sell their products but more orientated towards c2c trading rather than b2c. Also unable to promote services through this. 
- GroupOn: Provides a platform for businesses to display offers/discounts however is not appropriately utilized in Ireland compared to US. Argument that its not properly utilised in US either. I want to take GroupOns idea of displaying deals and discounts and intertwine it with MarketPlace concept to allow businesses to display their own offers. 
- Amazon: Amazon is consumerism gone mad and has crippled local economies. I want to take this Amazon concept in terms of product directory and allow local smes to reap the rewards. Also with services. 
- GMB: Captures business important info and displays this in known and unknown search. 
- Fiver: gives businesses a platform to avail of services that may be more costly to get done elsewhere. 

Tech considerations? <br>
The purposes of this assignment is to build out an App using Python primarily. However, like all good apps,  this is built with mobile in mind. I will be building this from Mobile view out to desktop. 

Why would a user want this? <br>
Purpose of this is to help promote local commerce in a way that both local smes and its consumers will find beneficial. I want customers to be adequately informed of deals and offers available to them and businesses be able to communicate their offers, products and services to its potential customers. 


Who is my target audience? <br>
- My product is for both businesses and consumers alike. 

For Businesses: <br>
- The aim of Project FruGaol is to help promote and nurture local commerce. The end goal is to have an application that is the go to for any small or medium sized enterprise to generate business. 

For consumers: <br>
- As a consumer looking to engage more with local smes, a good experience means great customer service, competitive pricing, ability to receive my product/service in as short a timeframe as possible. 
- For the purposes of this app, as a customer I want to come straight through to page with offers & discounts displayed and available. As a business user, I want to be able to display my offers/products/services as quickly and easily as possible. 
- A good user experience would be being able to see from the get go what offers/deals are available to me. From this page I want ability to be able to search for products/services/categories that are near to me.

How is our offering, or proposed offering, different from our competitors and substitutes? <br>

FruGaol differs from the competition as no other platform has attempted to connect local SMEs to its consumers in this way. MarketPlace and Goldenpages are closest to this app but Marketplace is more focused on C2C while GoldenPages acts as a glorified phonebook rather than a platform that is actively attempting to promote local commerce.
